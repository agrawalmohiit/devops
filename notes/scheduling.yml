## QoS
Guaranteed : # requests and limits both are configured
Burstable : # only requests configured
BestEffort: # nothing configured

## Priority
 # When new pods are scheduled - only pod priority is considered
 # In case of of out-of-resources Eviction - both priority and QoS is considered

## Eviction : 
  # When the node is pressurised - it evicts a pod in the order BestEffort > Burstable > Guaranteed
