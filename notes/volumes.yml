# A kubernetes volume will survive container restarts but not a pod restart as it belongs within the pod - so we donâ€™t use K8s volume but a Persistent Volume (which is outside the pod)

# Persistent Volume - How to provision the PersistentVolume

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: local-storage
spec:
  storageClassName: mylocalstorage
  capacity:
    storage: 20Gi # Size of space on the hard disk to be reserved by this cluster - creates a resource on a specific cloud
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/some new/directory/structure/" # path on the host machine where data will be mounted
    type: DirectoryOrCreate

# Persistent Volume Claim - Create a piece of Persistent Volume with specific requirements

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mongo-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: mylocalstorage # used to "bind" a specific PersistentVolume to this PVC
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi # portion required from the space reserved by the PersistentVolume ; always lower 


# - Does not reference the PV from which the space will be allocated by default - requires storageClassName
# - Binding happens after meeting 3 criterias - size, accessModes & storageClassName

# Deployment Config - Where do we want to use that piece ? 
# - Mention volume and container volume inside deployment spec	

spec:   
  volumes:
    - name: # arbitrary vol name
      hostPath: # path on the host machine where volume will be mounted
      # While the above works, it has to be updated everywhere in case of moving to a different cloud provider
      # So instead use a Pointer to another config (Claim) about the specifics which is easier to update in case of changes 
    - name: # arbitrary name
      persistentVolumeClaim: # says this pod should request for a volume from k8s as specified in the claim  
      claimName: # name of the pvc required

# Mention the volume mounts for each container in the deployment

spec:    
  containers:        
    volumeMounts:          
      - name: # name of the specific pod volume to be mounted             
        mountPath: # location on the container to be mounted (defaults to /data/db for mongo and /var/lib/postgresql/data for postgres)
