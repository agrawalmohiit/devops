Why is a container name inside a deployment given without writing metadata and with a -  (isnâ€™t - used for a list ? )

Understanding CrashLoopBackOff and Completed status? 
Job objects are also not cleaned from the cluster once process completed, so why cant we just use a Pod with restartPolicy=OnFailure ?
