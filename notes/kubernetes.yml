- Namespacing and CongrolgroupsÂ  features belong to a linux system - not win not macos
- Docker desktop creates a linux virtual machine on the computer 
- Docker on Mac uses a native MacOS virtualization system called Hyperkit
- Minikube for Mac supports multiple hypervisors such as VirtualBox, VMWare, and Hyperkit
- When using Docker Desktop's Kubernetes instead of Minikube - the cluster is available at localhost instead of Minikube ip
- Pods are short lived
- Pods are not accessible outside k8s cluster - require a service / clusterip to be exposed
- Run a command inside pod - k exec -it <pod name> <command> (-it is for input )
- Open container shell : k exec -it <pod name> -- sh
- Deployments manage multiple pods and spin new pods if one dies
- ReplicaSets are used to tell K8s how many pods are to be run at any time

- SECRET is also an object like a pod
- Kubectl create : Imperative way of creating an object (without a config file)
- LoadBalancer service is not used because it can give access to only one set of pods and not multiple deployments, Ingress can do that
- ingresses are native objects inside the cluster that can route to multiple services, while load balancers are external to the cluster and only route to a single service
